•	Deep Learning Model: The core of the project was the deep learning model,which integrated transfer learning with ResNet50 and the U-Net architecture.
This combination enabled the model to achieve impressive accuracy levels, reaching 99.01% in training and 98.9% in testing phase.

•	Flask Web Application: The project utilized Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, to deploy the machine learning model as a web application.
Flask provided the infrastructure necessary to handle HTTP requests and responses, facilitating the integration of the model with the web interface.

•	HTML/CSS/JS Frontend: The frontend of the web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These technologies were employed to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for uploading CT scan images and displaying the segmentation results.
